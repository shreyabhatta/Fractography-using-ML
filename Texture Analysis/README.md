# TEXTURE ANALYSIS

Texture refers to a sequence of pixel values, such as a pattern in an image, and texture analysis is a method used to characterize such texture.

There are Five typical texture analyses:
1. Gray Level Histogram
2. Gray Level Difference
3. Co-occurrence Matrix
4. Run Length Matrix
5. Fourier Power Spectrum

We let the number of pixel values in the target image be L and the pixel value be l(0<=l<=L-1).
